I heard you were coming to find it, I gave you that hallucinogentic herbs. I then sent you here so I could kill you and take all your money away from everyone else. HAHAHAHAHAAHHhahah. You: That seems uneccassarily complicated. Juan: I need my money too, (player name). Juan lays still until he breathes his last breath. You get up and walk out the temple, baffled. The sun never looked so bright in your life.
